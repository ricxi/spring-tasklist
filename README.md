# spring-tasklist
A simple tasklist (or todo list) application that uses a Spring Boot backend and a React/TypeScript frontend. Just a disclaimer, but I pulled this together in January when my React skills were a bit rusty. I also wrote a light bash script to help me develop the java backend (it was never intended for serious use).

I thought this app was lost forever when my old linux system finally gave out, but I was able to recover it today :smiley:!
  
### Instructions
